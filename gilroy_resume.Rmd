**Summary:** Computational social scientist & PhD candidate, with 7+ years of experience analyzing text, spatial, network, and survey data. I have broad skills in statistics, programming, and written and visual communication of analytic insights. My dissertation research uses NLP methods and survey data to explain variations in expressions and experiences of community across digital and location-based contexts.

**Skills:** programming (R, Python, SQL, and Stan), data collection (webscraping and webcrawling, geocoding, APIs), databases (Hive, PostgreSQL), surveys (stratified survey design and weighting), statistical modeling (GLMs, hierarchical models, regularized regression, random forests, Bayesian statistics), text analysis (topic modeling, word embeddings), data visualization (ggplot2, matplotlib, shiny)\vspace{-6pt}
